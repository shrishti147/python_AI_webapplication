How to Run Python Script in Apache Web Server

Here are the steps to run python script in Apache web server.



1. Install Python
In Linux, run the following command to get location of python installation

$ locate python

2. Edit Apache Configuration
Open Apache Configuration file in a text editor. Here are the different possible locations of configuration file depending on your operating system.

## Linux
/etc/apache2/httpd.conf
/etc/apache2/apache2.conf
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

## Windows
C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\conf\httpd. conf
Look for the following line.

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
Add ExecCGI to this line.

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
Next, look for the following line.

#AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
Uncomment it by removing # at the beginning of the line.

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
And add a .py at the end of the line.

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py
In order to execute python scripts in Apache, you need to use an Apache module, like CGI module, to run. That is why assign cgi-script module as the handler for .py files (python scripts).

Save and close the file.


3. Restart Apache
Restart Apache server to apply changes.

# Windows
Start -> All Programs -> Apache . . . -> Control Apache Server menu option

# Linux
$ service apache2 restart


4. Run Python Script on Apache
Create a new file and add the following python code in it.

#!/usr/bin/python
print "Content-type: text/html"
print
print "<html><head>"
print ""
print "</head><body>"
print "Hello."
print "</body></html>"
Save this file as test.py in htdocs folder under Apache installation directory. Open web browser, and visit apache host (and :port if the port is something other than 80) followed by test.py. For example,

http://localhost/test.py
You should be able to see ‘Hello.’ message.

After that once you're able to run apache web server, save your python script in cgi-bin folder and you'll be able to run the script on http://localhost/cgi-bin/pyth.py
